This app can be used as a tool for comparative visualisation of tweet
aggregations. It shows how the number of tweets has varied over a period of time.
This variation can easily be compared with the variations in the distribution
of tweets related to other queries. Such variations can give us an idea on change in trends related
to various topics on social media.
