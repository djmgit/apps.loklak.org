MultiLinePlotter is a data visualizing app which allows user to visually
compare tweet aggregations and statistics. Users can compare distribution
of tweets containing a given query over a period of time.

## How to use this app

Enter a query word in the input field (for eg. fossasia) and press the button
beside it (button with **plus** symbol). A line graph showing tweet distribution
(number of tweets containing the query word v/s date) will be plotted. Continue
adding more query words, more lines will be added in the same graph, providing
a visual comparision of the tweet distributions.

Every query word searched will be displayed in the search record section. Clicking
on a record will open a dialogue showing tweet statistics related to that query
and the individual tweets. A series from the graph can also be removed by clicking
on the **remove** button present on the individual records.

The graph mode can also be changed from aggregations to statistics by clicking the
small button present on the top right corner of the graph section. The other graph mode
shows statistics like maximum tweets and average tweets for all the query words
present.
