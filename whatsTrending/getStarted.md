#### whatsTrending app gives us a list of the top trending Hashtags on twitter.

It provides us with statistics showing the top Hashtags and the corresponding count
of the tweets containing them.

The app also visualises the above collected statistics using a **pie chart**.

#### How to use the app

On launching the app the user is presented with the current top trending hashtags
along with their frequency in a tabular format and a corresponding pie chart
to visualise the data.

The user can also filter the hashtags by a given date range and count.
To do apply filters press on **apply filters** and provide the neccessary
filtering values - **Start Date**, **End Date** and **Count**. and press
filter. The data will reload with the filters applied.

The users can reuse the pie chart by getting a local copy of it. This can be done
by pressing the hamburger on the top right corner of the chart and selecting a suitable
download option.
